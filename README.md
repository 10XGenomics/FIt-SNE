# FFT-accelerated Interpolation-based t-SNE (FIt-SNE) for Windows

## Introduction
This is a slight modification of https://github.com/KlugerLab/FIt-SNE to allow its compilation under Windows. The original source codes are in the src folder. The FItSNE folder includes slightly modified source codes and files added to allow for compilation using MS Visual Studio; the Visual Studio project and solutions are added. The ffwt folder has also been added; this provides the FFWT library needed to compile FIt-SNE. This library is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
